In order to add a new database migration create a new file with a version increased by 1. 
Flyway will be able to detect new migration during application startup and will automatically apply it.
For example:
```
└───src/main/resources/db/migration
    └───V1__create_payment_table.sql
    └───V2__your_database_change.sql <-- here you go (notice the prefix pattern 'V2__')
```

Stop:

Press <kbd>ctrl+c</kbd> or stop _Application.main_ from IDE.
